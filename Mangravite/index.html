<h1>Peppino Mangravite</h1>
<p>Starting with art lessons from local painters in Italy Peppino Mangravite evolved into an active memeber of the American art world in the 1930s and 40s. Today information on the artist is scattered across archieval collections and his art work in museum store rooms. This web site is the start of a reavaulation of the artists, a man which many artists credit their artistic education.</p>
<h2>American Art in the 1930s</h2>
<p>American art  <blockquote>"Smack in the middle of this world [American art in the 1930s], and very much a part of it, was a 42-year olf American painter of Italian descent with the rather exotic name of Peppino Mangravite. That name in 1938 was nationally recognized as belonging to one of America's more successful painters and teachers."</blockquote>1
<p>The exhibit guide continues to talk about his acomplishments and acknowledge that he had not "exactly a household name" but that in the American art community he did have a prodominant role.</p>
<p>There is an idea presented by mamy American art scholars that American art ended in 1945 and in the post-war world the work produced in the 1930s and 40s was pushed into the storage rooms to clear the way for the new universal art.</p>
<p>The dismissal from the gallery walls some have said is not surprising, yet whether his style is ones personal taste or not he does hold a place in the history of American art.</p>
