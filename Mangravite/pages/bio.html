<h1>Peppino Mangravite</h1>
<h3>(1896-1978)</h3>
<p>The son of an Italian naval officer Peppino Mangravite was born in Lipari, Italy, a small island off the northern coast of Sicily. He started studying art early and received training from several teachers in Carrara, Italy. Upon his fatherâ€™s retirement in 1912 the family moved to New York where Mangravite attended Cooper Union Art School and the Art Students League, studying with Robert Henri.</p>
<p>In the early 1920s Mangravite worked decoratoring of church interiors and began to teach art to some of the local children. He enjoyed the experiance and found a position in 1926 at the Potomac School in Washington D.C. and then at the Ethical Cultural School in New York in 1928. This began Mangravite's career as a teacher working at such institutions as;<ul><li>Sarah Lawrence School (1930-35)</li><li>Colorado Springs Fine Art Center (1937-38)</li><li>Cooper Union Art School (1937-42)</li><li>Art Students League (1940-41)</li><li>Art Institute of Chicago (1940-42)</li><li>Columbia University (1942-64)</li></ul><p>Mangravite was fortunate to be able to earn a living as a teacher which enabled him to pursue his own painterly activities.</p><p>In 1955 Columbia University and the State Department allowed Mangravite to traveled in Europe interviewing some of the outstanding artists. During this time he spoke with artists such as Braque, Chagall and de Chirico. After retirement from teaching in 1964 Mangravite devoted more time to his painting and continued until his death in 1978 in Cornwall, Connecticut.</p>
