Mangravite also executed a mural for the Governor’s Mansion in the Virgin Islands in 1942. In the late 1940s Mangravite was include in exhibitions at many prestigious museums including the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Modern Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, the Carnegie Institute, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. </p>
