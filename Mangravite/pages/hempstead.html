<h1>Hempstead, New York</h1>
<p>Located on Long Island, Hempstead, New York’s Post Office was Mangravite’s first Secton commission. He had not been the post office competition winner; instead Edward Rowan selected Mangravite because it was felt that James Brooks, the jury selected artist, did not have the skills needed to execute the mural.


They wanted a mural that highlighted their history, specifically events that they were proud of and viewed as playing an important role in the formation and success of the Country. 

In December of 1935 a letter reached Mangravite stating… <blockquote>“I have heard from the Postmaster at Hempstead and I know that he and the Hempstead citizens are very much in favor of having the subject of the mural paintings for the Post Office local in character. You will find Mr. Hartnett and the other members of the committee extremely nice people and I would suggest if you have not already done so, that you see them.”</blockquote>

By January 20, 1936, Mangravite who was living in New York had returned from meeting with the mayor and the local committee. He reported back to Rowan that the meeting had gone well and they “discussed the importance of certain types of historical subject matter.”  The conversation between Rowan, the Hempstead committee and Mangravite continued through letters. The selection of only two historical images was difficult and there was hope that the project could be extended to include three more mural panels in order to include all the historically significant aspects the community wished to show.</p>

<p>Ultimately two subjects were selected for the murals. One features the settling of Hempstead, which according to Hempstead Public Library depicts “the early settlement of Hempstead from the Indians, English landing in Roslyn and driving their cattle south to Hempstead, and the stockade in Hempstead” (Figure 1).   The other mural is the arrival of British dirigible R-34 in 1919. The air ship had flown from Scotland to Roosevelt Field in Hempstead, New York in four and a half days. The journey was the first international air mail delivery (Figure 2). The selection of the air ship’s landing is significant because Mangravite used the iconography of the air ship as a device in painting an optimistic message for the community. This was only one of the several “firsts” which he could have selected including, the “first provincial legislature in the State of New York,” or “one of the first stage coach routes.” 
Firsts were a popular theme for the Post Office murals painted as part of the Section program. As Marling explains this use of “firsts” in Post Office murals was because “the history of “firsts” constituted the modern folklore of a Depression epoch whose own firsts were liable to be on the order of record unemployment figures.”  The subliminal message to the community made a first the perfect choice for Mangravite. The ability to connect a “first” to the town built communal pride and placed the town into the fabric of America’s success. This was an important message during a period in American history when there seemed to be few things Americans could be proud of. Documenting these images in a public place acted as a gentle reminder of the greatness of the Country. This particular first provided Mangravite with the perfect iconography for his idea of American optimism. The fact that the air ships arrival was also the first example of air mail was fitting for a mural on display in a post office.
The final mural composition makes it evident that Mangravite studied newspaper images of the historic event. The mural captures the action of the landing, cropping the airship and the men in a photographic style, which places the viewer within the cluster of men spilling out of the frame in the foreground. There is a sense that the air ship is floating above with its tail floating off the mural’s top boarder. The small figures of men in the distance pulling on the air ships tethers enhance the understanding of the machine’s scale. By placing the viewer in the airfield with the soldiers on the day of the R-34’s arrival Mangravite pulls the event from the past into the present day. The inclusion of a mail truck on the right side of the mural is the only reminder to the viewer of the postal connection.
True to the importance of the murals message the focus was strong men working together. The foreground shows American military men pulling the air ship into place as the commander shouts through a megaphone. On a basic level the image is one of American and British government working together, operating a machine connected to war. The image at this level serves as a reminder of the strong American war hero and that Americans can overcome the evils of the world. Importantly, these laboring men have transformed a machine of war into one which will create a prosperous future for the Country through connectivity with the world. 
This connectivity with the world through air mail was a historic moment that’s implications moved beyond Hempstead. Indeed, the landing of the R-34 was historic for the nation and represented both innovation and progress. At the time of the flight newspapers quoted the crew as saying “regular airship service between Europe and America is bound to come soon.”  The idea was forming that delivery of mail was only the beginning of the air ships’ usefulness. The crew stressed how this new means of flight was the future. It would not interfere with planes, but rather travel the long distances the planes could not. The entrepreneurial spirit of American Dream can be seen in the article. It states that the Americans saw the “commercial possibilities” of the airship.   Not to be lost in the glory of the moment the postal service was included with letters and newspapers which made the journey representing the hope that this trip would “prove the fastest newspaper delivery between New York and London yet accomplished and will be the forerunner of a regular interchange of mail.” 
This achievement did not disappear from the minds of the Americans quickly; an Associated Press newspaper article written nine years later reminds us how significant the event was. The article places the R-34’s success as an event which was not seen again until 1927 with the Atlantic flight of Charles Lindbergh. In the 1920s and ‘30s the air ship in America was the future and Mangravite’s R-34 connected the historical past of Hempstead with the future of America. Even during the Depression the air ship was an icon of the optimism the future held.
At the end of World War I the image of the air ship moved from newsreels to the pages of magazines and beyond. To look at the popular culture of the period this dream machine idea is clear. Publishers placed air ships on magazine covers including Popular Science in 1923 and 1928, Popular Mechanics in 1930 and Boys Life in 1931 (Figure 3).  The magazine published by the Boy Scouts of America included the air ship on the cover that went with an article about the progress that the Graf Zeppelin was making in transforming travel.   Other magazines included drawings of the cabins and dining rooms on board the air ships along with stories of the machines future and progress. The postal service issued stamps depicted the different models (Figure 4).   Air ships were use on advertising posters and news reports tracked the various flights and technological advancements being made. The fascination with the machine was so large that there was a Los Angeles diner in the 1930s called the Zep Diner, in the shape of the air ship.  The media in the United States and Europe had taken hold of the war machine and changed it into an icon of the mechanized age and connectivity. This ship was seen as part of a new international air mail system and a travel industry which allowed for travel to distant places. Most importantly in the United States it represented new industries for a nation in search of jobs.


Mangravite’s use of a historical image of an air ship to show the optimistic future rather than a more modern version was more than simply following the request of the Hempstead community for murals of historical nature. In fact, Mangravite was not the only artist to include this icon of the future; an air ship was included in August Henkel’s Floyd Bennett Airfield mural (Figure 5).  The 1930s air ship version in Henkel’s mural however was caught up in his communist affiliations and the image of Stalin in the mural lead to its destruction in the 1940s.  Mangravite’s historical representation placed the air ship in safe period, away from any negative connotations which were starting to mount particularly in connection to the German Graf Zepplin. Nationwide the Zeppelin was a huge part of this continued interest in air ships and Germany was a leading nation in the development of the air machines. The air machines were being built as part of an alliance between America and Germany in order to allow transatlantic flights.  However in the mid-1930s the growing concerns about the actions of The National Socialists Party and Hitler in Germany made the arrival of the German Graf Zeppelin at the 1933 World’s Fair in Chicago a sensitive affair. The German government wanted the swastika flag flown at the German-American building, a request that lead to arguments between the fair organizers and the German government. Ultimately the flag was not flown.  However, when the air ship arrived at the fair with swastikas on its fins, it was not something that could be ignored. The new air ship was thus becoming a sign of the “New Germany” and Germany’s “reclaimed military prowess,” not the optimistic image Mangravite was looking to show on the Post Office wall. 
It was Mangravite’s first mural for the Section and to avoid any confusion or controversy he was very careful to make it clear that the air ship he painted was the historical R-34. The air ships numbers were predominately displayed on its side in the center of the mural. To reinforce the historical nature he required an accurate representation. Mangravite made a point to let Rowan know that he was taking the accuracy of his murals seriously, his letter from March of 1936 talks of the “tremendous amounts of research that has been necessary for the authenticity of my sketches.”  Mangravite’s interest in research and projecting the correct image is clear from his notes and letters. He researched the R-34’s arrival in old copies of The New York Times noting the images “striking view of the R-34” and important names which appeared in the paper from July 2 thru the 7, 1919. His brief notes include the fact that “twenty piles of gas cylinders waiting to supply the R-34”, a detail which is included in the murals foreground. 
In 1936, Mangravite was in search of more accuracy then he was able to obtain from the newspapers. Writing to the U.S. Navy for information on the air ship, he states that “the work I am doing is for and has been commissioned for the United States Government.”  Unable to get a response he contacted Rowan asking for help to get the coloring on the air ships fins correct. Rowan forwarded this request to Dr. Zahn at the Library of Congress with a note stating “Mr. Mangravite is most anxious to get accurate data and materials on this event.”  The Hempstead air ship was not a German machine, the carefully colored tail and historical setting removed any negative connotation. The historical image of the R-34, with its accurately painted fins was able to avoid any connection to Germany and remain a symbol of an optimistic future for America. This all was before the mural was hung in March of 1937.It was before May 6, 1937 when the image of the air ship changed from that of an optimistic future of easy travel to one of horror and death as the Hindenburg crashed.
