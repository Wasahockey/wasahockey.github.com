<p>In early June of 1934 Mangravite was in contact with the Treasury Department Public Works of Art Project (PWAP). He received a letter from Forbes Watson at PWAP stating that while “you could do a swell mural… we haven’t any very tangible plans for giving out definite mural projects.”  As the programs under the control of the Treasury Department formalized Mangravite submitted sketches for the Section mural competitions. Then in July of the following year Mangravite submitted a design for the Pittsburg Federal Court room competition. His design was not selected, but the entry placed Mangravite’s information in Forbes Watson's "Recommended for appointment as a result of Justice Competition” folder. 
By the time the Section program ended in the early 1940s Mangravite had completed four mural commissions, two in New York, one in New Jersey and a set for the Governors’ Mansion in the Charlotte Amalie, Virgin Islands. One New York set was hung in 1937 and the Atlantic City set was hung in 1939. The last two mural commissions would be hung in 1940 and 1942, just as the program was ending. During this time he took care in the selection of the murals content, declining a 1937 commission for the Southwark Post Office due to subject matter.  Ultimately, his careful selection process meant that he avoided any controversy or major content changes to his murals by the Section administration.  This lack of controversy may be the reason why little has been written about his murals. Their content is mentioned only briefly in both Barbara Melosh in Engendering Culture and Karal Ann Marling in Wall-to-Wall America.
Mangravite received $4,425 for the Hempstead, New York, commission and three years later he was paid $1,500 for his Jackson Heights, New York, mural.  He was happy to have the additional income, but it is clear that money was not the motivation behind his interest in Section’s activities. His families’ finical security in the early 1930s came from teaching positions at various institutions and the sale of his painting at the Rehn Gallery in New York. During this period he also received a grant to study in Italy and he wrote articles for several art publications. The true impetus was the opportunity to paint murals for the public. He believed in the progressive era educational model of teaching through seeing and the importance of murals in the education and growth of the country. It was important for Mangravite to take part in the murals movement because he believed that “young Americans had lost the American Dream to push them forward.”  As a foreign born artist, his participation in the government program also showed his support for his adoptive country.

  Peppino Mangravite Papers, 1918-1982 (Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. n.d.).Reel #5878 Image #274. There was no record of the letter which Mangravite had sent to PWAP, only the response.
  File folder of Forbes Watson. This document is in the collection of the National Achieves at College Park (NACP), College Park, MD, in Record Group 121 (Records of Federal Works Agency. Public Buildings Administration. Section of Fine Arts. (1939 - 1949) (Most Recent)Department of the Treasury. Procurement Division. Public Buildings Branch. (06/10/1933 - 07/01/1939) (Predecessor), Correspondence of Officials, Compiled 1934 - 1943), Inventory Entry 125 (Forbes Watson Correspondences 1935 -1941), Box 2. Hereafter, materials in the record group 121 will be cited by a descriptive phrase followed by the inventory entry number and description, and a box number.
  Peppino Mangravite Papers, 1918-1982. Reel #5878. In an April 6, 1937 letter from Edward Rowan to Mangravite, Rowan “explained to the architect that it was the subject matter which did not appeal” to Mangravite. It continues on to express that Mangravite felt that the building should in fact not have any mural decorations.
  While Barbara Melosh expresses in her book Engendering Culture (page 209) that there was an issue between Rowan and Mangravite over the depiction of Miss America this was minimal at most. More on this particular correspondence will be discussed in relation to the Atlantic City mural commission later.
