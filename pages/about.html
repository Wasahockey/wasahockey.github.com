<h2>About Me</h2><div class="travel"><img src="file:///C|/Users/Wasa DZ/Documents/GitHub/wasahockey.github.com/images/europe.gif"><p>Cath√©drale Notre-Dame de Paris, France</p></div>I grew up in a very small Vermont town surrounded by artistic community members. It was a positive influenced to learn from so many amazingly creative people who explored a while range of media from paint and glass. At the young age of nine I was given "real" watercolor paper by a family friend and I carefully planned what I would fill the pages with.</p><p>By the time I was in high school I knew that wanted a job that allowed be to be creative and experiance living in other places. College brought me to Philadephia, after four years I left Philly with a bachelors in graphic design and moved further south. 

Shortly after graduation I moved to Northern Virginia, where I currently live with my husband of five years and our two cats. I spend my free time working on creative projects using materials like glue, paint, computer graphics and more. There are actually very few artistic things I don't enjoy. 

I also love traveling abroad
my favorite aspects are exploring distinct sites and learning about other cultures.</p>
<p>Currenly I split my time between Northern Virginia and Seattle. Together with my husband of nine years I have traveled
