Decided to return to school and study art history, something that I had alsways be intereseted in 

I grew up in a very small Vermont town surrounded by artistic community members. It was a positive influenced to learn from so many amazingly creative people who explored a while range of media from paint and glass. At the young age of nine I was given "real" watercolor paper by a family friend and I carefully planned what I would fill the pages with.</p><p>By the time I was in high school I knew that wanted a job that allowed be to be creative and experiance living in other places. College brought me to Philadephia, after four years I left Philly with a bachelors in graphic design and moved further south. 

Shortly after graduation I moved to Northern Virginia, where I currently live with my husband of five years and our two cats. I spend my free time working on creative projects using materials like glue, paint, computer graphics and more. There are actually very few artistic things I don't enjoy. 

I also love traveling abroad
my favorite aspects are exploring distinct sites and learning about other cultures.</p>
<p>Currenly I split my time between Northern Virginia and Seattle. Together with my husband of nine years I have traveled</p>

<!--My desire to learn the details of art started when I was twelve and my Cricket magazine arrived in the mail with Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose on its cover. I read the story of the painting over and over and over, completely hooked to the story not only on the canvas but also beyond the frame’s edge. Living in rural Vermont I did not understand that I could make a life where a love of art was valuable.
There were just over 50 students in my high school graduating class and college was the way to interact with a larger group of people and move on from Vermont. That goal was my focus while gaining my bachelor’s degree. Looking for career with a creative focus, I was guided to study graphic design. This path allowed me to enjoy color theory, drawing and studio photography lessons; however my required art history classes were the courses which had the greatest influence. Sitting in the dark lecture halls I thought, “How could a person take something so interesting and make it so boring?” I knew I could do a better job, but I told myself I would have to wait until I was older to explore that idea.
For my final undergraduate graphic design project, I tried to convince my professor that I could create a grade school teacher’s workbook. My idea was to provide a way for teachers to encourage young children to learn standard lessons with the inclusion of art. Unfortunately he felt that it did not show enough of the design elements that were required for the program. Together we agreed that I would create a children’s book, teaching colors through use of paintings by famous artists. Then in 2000 after receiving my degree I went to work designing brochures, flyers and advertisements for various clients. It built my understanding of visual communication and developing new ways to present information. While design has continued to be enjoyable; the subject matter always made it simply a job.
In my time away from work I volunteered at the Smithsonian’s American History Museum for a year and bored my family and friends with facts about paintings and artists gathered from books. I have been fortunate enough to travel abroad and explore new cultures, subjects I use for more passionate design. Traveling has also has allowed me to visit museums such as the State Hermitage Museum were I was captivated by the impressionist collection. When preparing to travel to Russia I had read about this unique collection and seeing the elements that art historians had detailed in my reading is something I feel lucky to have experienced. Now when I spend time with my nieces, I want to encourage in them an interest in art.
In 2009, my husband asked, “what is stopping you from studying art history? Why do you say you will do it someday?” I did not have an answer, so “someday” became today, and I began researching local degree programs. Looking at my transcript I felt challenged. I knew that I could do better than what that piece of paper stated and I also knew that simply stepping into a master’s program was not going to be the right path for me. After talking with program advisors at several schools, I was given the most honest assessment of my path at George Mason. While it clearly would not be easy, nor would I be selecting any sort of guaranteed acceptance or a smooth career track, there was an encouragement towards my goal that lead me to decide it was the correct path to take.
As my hope of teaching art history becomes more tangible and I have added attending school to life, I am confident that it is the right time in my life to follow this path. I want to take my graphic design and marketing skills, life experience and mesh them with what I am learning. Looking at how museums are communicating knowledge of art to the public, it is clear that my skills I have learned along my path are valuable to the art world. These skills provide me with a distinct view of art and understanding of the way art is communicated to the public. The classes I have taken continue to inspire and reassure me that this is the right direction. I believe there are ways I can inspire children and adults to feel the same way I did when I first looked at that Cricket magazine.-->
