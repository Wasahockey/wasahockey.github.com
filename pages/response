<h1>Responsive Design</h1>
<p>In an effort to inprove my writing and thinking about art a few years ago I started blogging. The goal was never really to share my blog with anyone, more to experiance the process and think about art in a different way. This worked to some extent but I quickly lost motivation to write very thought provoking posts and just gathered together some basic information on a few famous paintings. For our project on responsive design I have taken one of these posts and adapted it.</p>
<h2>The Disembarkation of Maria de’ Medici at the Port of Marseilles on November 3, 1600</h2>
<h4>Peter Paul Rubens, 1622 – 1625</h4>
<p>One of the 21 paintings Rubens was commissioned to paint by Marie de’ Medici, in the “Disembarkation” we can see how talented he was at painting the human figure. The posture of each individual is carefully constructed the emphasize Maria’s high status. She stands tall and regal as all those around her rejoice in her arrival. The the allegorical representation France takes a deep bow, with a sweeping gesture of welcome, the ships commander stands at attention while the sea is filled with bodies celebrating in her safe arrival in France.<blockquote>“The sea and sky rejoice at her safe arrival. Neptune and the Nereids salute her, and a winged, trumpeting Fame hovers overhead. Conspicuous in the gallery’s opulently carved stern-castle, under the Medici coat of arms, stand the imperious commander of the vessel, the only immobile figure in the composition.” Kleiner, Gardner’s Art Through the Ages, 676.</blockquote>Currently on view at Louvre in Paris.</p>
